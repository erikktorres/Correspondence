I am writing to inform you of the negative experience I had at the service department this morning (June 3rd, 2016) at Sunnyvale Toyota, the Toyota dealership in Sunnyvale, California. I arrived at the dealership for my scheduled appointment at about 8:30 am. The line to checkin extended out of the service department, down the driveway, and out onto Sunnyvale Road. When I joined the line there were five cars ahead of me on the street, four in the driveway leading into the service bay, and six more cars in the bay where service advisors were receiving customers. I was dropping off my Highlander to have a recalled part replaced on my way to work. Most people were probably on their way to work. My time is valuable, and time was of the essence. It seemed to be a busy morning at Sunnyvale Toyota. I had waited in line on Sunnyvale Road for about 25 minutes and was two cars from entering the driveway when a white Matrix S (see attached photo) drove past everyone lined up on Sunnyvale Road and cut in front of the Sienna just ahead of me. After about another 10 minutes, the line advanced, and I was in service bay ready to be checked in. Displeased with what the driver of the white Matrix had done, I informed the first employee I saw that the Matrix, now parked next to me, had cut into the line ahead of several cars. The employee dismissed my complaint, and went about his business noting license plate numbers and placing service tags on windshields. Then service advisor “Hector" approached the white Matrix and proceeded to checkin the customer. I approached Hector and informed him that his customer had cut in front of everyone and that the driver should go to the end of the line of cars backed up on Sunnyvale Road. The driver of the white Matrix claimed that she didn’t know that she had cut in front of anyone, she said that she was in a hurry, and said that she could re-schedule her service appointment. Hector dismissed my complaint and checked in the customer, business as usual. When I finished checking in my car and headed out to walk to my office. Cars were still lined up along the road in front of the dealership. In addition to the cars in the bay and driveway, there were now about 7 cars backed up on Sunnyvale Road waiting to meet with advisors.

Hector's decision to not address the situation of the line cutter did a disservice to all Toyota Sunnyvale service department customers this morning. Taking the white Matrix out of order was the easy solution. By not doing right by rest of us, that is, to have the Matrix driver either re-schedule, as she offered do, wait in the queue with everyone else, or at least apologize to the customers that she cut in front of, Hector is more likely to get a positive rating on the Matrix driver's customer's satisfaction survey. However, the satisfaction surveys of the customers that Hector advised today will not necessarily be an accurate measure of his performance. Hector’s conduct had an impact on many customers —not only those he directly served. Morning checkin at service departments can be very dynamic. I understand this. I also understand that it is likely cost prohibitive for Toyota service departments to have reception areas with excess space to handle the spikes of arrivals that occur on the busiest of mornings —with a parking slot for each customer and a friendly and helpful service advisor waiting to receive them and help them on their way. The reality is that service departments may not have the staff and space to handle morning spikes in drop offs with zero wait time for customers. Instead, customers queue up, are respectful of other’s time, and wait their turn to meet with a service advisor.

When I purchased my Toyota in 2014, I was offered an extended pre-paid four-year service plan. I had never considered servicing my car at the dealership because I have an excellent and trustworthy mechanic that has maintained my cars for years. The person that offered additional products and services the day I bought my Toyota made a good case for me to pre-pay and use the Sunnyvale Toyota service department. He assured me that you had a professional staff, top-notch factory-certified mechanics, a comfortable waiting room with wi-fi, and shuttle service. Instead of passing on the service plan, I decided to try it based on his assurance of the quality and professionalism of your service department.

My experience with the service department this morning left much to be desired. It was certainly not “quality and convenience you can trust.” My complaint is not with the driver of the white Matrix. When I called her out on her line cutting she offered to Hector to re-schedule her service appointment. This would have been acceptable. This would have minimized the inconvenience she had caused to all of those in line behind her. In not handling the situation properly, Hector not only increased the wait time for several customers, but he was a poor representative of Toyota Sunnyvale and more broadly, he was a poor representative of Toyota Group. Hector's inaction today not only encouraged line cutting, but it also contributed to an atmosphere of disorder —the opposite of quality and convenience. Service advisor is a customer service role —a role that Hector definitely did not live up to this morning. I am confident that I would have never had this type of experience at the repair shop of my longtime trusted mechanic.

Several years ago when I used to drive a BMW 525i, I had an especially long commute. I wanted to drive a more practical commuter car. So I bought a used Camry. I happily commuted in that Camry for tens of thousands of miles. When I sold it, it had reliably clocked 250,000 miles. Pleased with the Toyota brand, I have since bought two new Toyotas and have recently been considering replacing my Highlander with a new Sequoia. After Hector’s behavior this morning, I question whether it was a good choice to pre-pay for an extended service plan at Toyota Sunnyvale, and, more fundamentally, if I should continue to buy Toyota vehicles.
